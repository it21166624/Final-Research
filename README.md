PredicterX 🐔
PredicterX is a machine learning-based project designed to predict egg yield based on environmental factors. This solution utilizes IoT devices for real-time data collection and provides accurate forecasts to optimize egg production.

Features 🚀
Predicts egg yield using factors like:
Temperature 🌡️
Humidity 💧
Light Intensity 💡
Noise Levels 🔊
Ammonia Levels 🧪
Feed Amount 🍗
Integrates with IoT devices for live data input.
User-friendly interface for predictions and insights.
Enhances decision-making for poultry farming.
Technologies Used 🛠️
